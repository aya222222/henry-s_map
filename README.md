 # the app's purpose
 After watching "The Confession Killer", I got very interested in this story and tried to find out how crazy the "murder road trip" he confessed to was. However, all information I could find was the states which he confessed to having committed murders in, as shown in the map.
So, based on the "Lucas Report" issued by Jim Mattox, the Attorney General of Texas , I've mapped all cases he officially confessed since he was arrested in 1983.
