            <!-- You must have heard about how police investigations work. You’ve read it in newspapers, seen it in movies, tv shows, and documentaries, the way detectives try their best to get a confession out of a suspect. They isolate the suspects, torture them mentally, even put words in their mouths, and sometimes suspects end up confessing to something they never did. 
            But what if I told you that there was a man who confessed to killing more than 200 people across the states just because he liked the “attention”. He wasn’t tortured, he wasn’t forced. He just played along with the detectives and told them what they wanted to hear. His name was  -->
            You may have heard of serial killers, being said "No one knows the true number of victims they killed. It might be more than they've confessed." 
            But what if it's opposite situation? There was a man who was happy to confess to killing more than 300 people that he never committed. He enjoyed getting attention, joining  "the investigation team" and work with rangers in exchange for a strawberry milkshake and cigarettes.

            <h2>About "The Confession Killer"</h2>
          <p> "The Confession Killer" is a 2019 American true crime documentary on  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/80213588">Netflix.</a> It received very high praise from the audience(100% on Rotten Tomato).
            <br>In the first episode, Lucas asked to the Judge, 'What are you going to do about the hundred other women I killed? '. It was the beginning of nightmare.
            From there, the number of killings Lucas confessed increased like a snowball. He then joined the Texas Ranger investigation team and received special treatment.
            However, some of victim's families and journalists began to have great doubts about his confession.
            <br>This documentary revealed America's distorted judicial and investigation system.

        <h2>About "Henry's map" project</h2>
      <p>
        After watching "The Confession Killer", I was very interested in this story and tried to find out how crazy his "murder road trip" he confessed was. 
        However, the information I could find was states he confessed to murder, as shown in the map.
        <br>So, based on the <a href="http://coldcasecameron.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Lucas-Report-1986.pdf">"Lucas Resport"</a> compiled by Jim Mattox of the Attorney of General of Texas , I've mapped all cases he officially confessed since he was arrested in 1983.
        But it is said he confessed more than these cases.
        <br>If you know any cases that Lucas confessed that is not on this <a href="/map/index.html">map</a>, it would be helpful if you could contact me from <a href="/contact/index.html">contact</a> page with the resources specified.
